I am quite interested in programming language design and implementation, so I spend a large amount of my time implementing random tiny programming languages and VMs, mostly as proof-of-concepts. I *would* have more information about esolangs in general, but [esolangs.org](https://esolangs.org/wiki) does a better job than I could.

List of esolangs I've made/been involved with:
- [Fred](https://github.com/Baidicoot/fred-lang); my first machine-executable compiler. Compiles a minimalist FORTH-like language to C.
- [Treesolang](https://github.com/Baidicoot/Treesolang); based off Haskell pattern matching and kind system, this was inspired by [this blog post](https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview).
- [SCC](https://github.com/Baidicoot/ModRiscVM); this is probably the first compiler that I wrote when I was 14.
- [Soviet-Forth](https://github.com/Baidicoot/soviet-forth); a language started off a joke someone made about communal functions; functions are global to the entire internet.
- [RPNCalcV4](https://github.com/Baidicoot/rpncalc-v4); Like RPNCalc, but complete with lambdas.
