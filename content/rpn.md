RPNCalc (probably) started off as an experiment on [osmarks.tk](https://osmarks.tk). It went through multiple revisions, with Oliver eventually adding (botched) support for more complex operations like the Y combinator and `fold`. I wanted to create a version that *actually worked*, so I stole the IP from him, and somehow turned RPNCalc into a programming language, which turned out to be surprisingly un-esoteric. Since it is currently unimplemented on [osmarks.tk](https://osmarks.tk), I host it [here](https://rpn.aidanpe.duckdns.org).

Documentation to be added here soon. Maybe. When I feel like it.

Credit to Oliver for giving me the idea and Joshua Bulch for writing the tokenizer.
