<img src="../img/code.png" alt="This is the first part of a 3-image sequence documenting how I (attempted to) create a 'black hole'/gravitational lensing effect in OpenGL. It shows a fragment of the source code with the lensing effect applied.">
<img src="../img/color.png" alt="The next image in the sequence shows the gravitational lensing effect applied on the result of loading an RGBA image like an RGB one. It attempts to represent the pain that is wading through OpenGL errors.">
<img src="../img/galaxy.png" alt="The final image in the sequence shows a simulated image of Andromeda being distorted by a black hole in the foreground.">
<img src="../img/h2o.png" alt="This is a representation of the forces at work around an H2O molecule; the direction of the force corresponds to the color of the pixel." class="half"><img src="../img/h2o0.png" alt="This is the 2nd image in my series about interatomic forces; the strange warping of the pixels arises from an error in RGB-HSL conversion." class="half">
<img src="../img/h2o1.png" alt="This image is a midpoint between vaguely sensible-looking force diagrams and the nonsense that is image 4." class="half"><img src="../img/h2o2.png" alt="This is the 4th, and most erroneous, of the images in my series about interatomic forces." class="half">
<img src="../img/torus.png" alt="This is just a regular torus constructed out of quads, but my hacked-together mesh loader could only handle meshes made out of triangles. The resulting image looks quite cool when 
raytraced.">
